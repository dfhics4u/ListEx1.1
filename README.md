# ListEx1.1 #
###Review and practise working with lists and their methods.###
* Create an empty list
* Ask the user for 5 pieces of information and append each one into your list.
* Output the list so that it is sorted in reverse order
* Insert the word 'python' into the 3rd index of the list
* Print out the index of 'python'
* Print out the number of times 'python' appears in the list


Questions
1. What does the alist.index() method return?
2. While alist.count(object) will return the number of times an object appears in your list, how can you check if a given object is in your list?
3. What is the difference between a method and a function?
