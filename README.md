###Review and practise working with lists and their methods.###
* Create an empty list
* Ask the user for 5 pieces of information and append each one into your list.
* Output the list so that it is sorted in reverse order
* Insert the word 'python' into the 3rd index of the list
* Print out the index of 'python'
* Print out the number of times 'python' appears in the list
* Create a copy of your list
* Use the alist.pop() method on your copied list
* Print the 3rd through 5th element of your copied list using list slicing

Questions

1. What does the alist.index() method return?
2. While alist.count(object) will return the number of times an object appears in your list, how can you check if a given object is in your list?
3. What does the alist.pop() method do if you include nothing in the parentheses.
4. What is the difference between a method and a function?
